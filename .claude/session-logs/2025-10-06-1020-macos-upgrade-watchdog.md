# Session Summary: macOS Upgrade Investigation & Watchdog Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Role:** SDE III
**Topic:** macOS upgrade troubleshooting, watchdog service implementation

---

## Session Overview

User reported that `start.sh` script stopped working after macOS upgrade to version 26.0.1. Investigation revealed the script was actually working, but multiple orphaned processes from previous sessions were causing MQTT connection contention. This led to implementing a comprehensive watchdog service for automatic recovery and a streamlined startup workflow.

---

## Key Findings

### Root Cause Analysis

**Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT):**
- macOS upgrade broke NanoMQ bindings
- System dependencies needed reinstallation
- Synergy log paths changed

**Actual Root Cause:**
1. **Multiple orphaned processes** - 7+ instances of `waldo.py` and `found-him.py` from previous sessions
2. **MQTT broker intermittent issues** - Broker had crashed/restarted (user confirmed)
3. **Process contention** - Multiple instances competing for same MQTT connections causing timeouts

**What Was NOT Broken:**
- ✓ macOS upgrade compatibility (26.0.1)
- ✓ NanoMQ bindings (`nanomq_bindings.cpython-311-darwin.so` working)
- ✓ Synergy log path (`/Users/scottfrancis/Library/Logs/Synergy/synergy.log`)
- ✓ Python environment (3.11.8)
- ✓ System dependencies (Xcode tools, CMake, compilers)
- ✓ Script functionality

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Service Management Scripts

#### [stop.sh](../../stop.sh)
**Purpose:** Cleanly stop all waldo.py and found-him.py processes

**Key Features:**
- Uses `pgrep` to find processes by command pattern
- Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM) with force-kill fallback (SIGKILL)
- Prevents orphaned process accumulation

**Implementation:**
```bash
pgrep -f "python3 ./waldo.py" | xargs kill
# Wait, then force kill if needed
pgrep -f "python3 ./waldo.py" | xargs kill -9
```

#### Enhanced [start.sh](../../start.sh#L39-L48)
**Changes:** Auto-cleanup before starting new services

**Added Logic:**
```bash
# Stop any existing instances before starting new ones
WALDO_PIDS=$(pgrep -f "python3 ./waldo.py" || true)
FOUND_HIM_PIDS=$(pgrep -f "python3 ./found-him.py" || true)

if [ -n "$WALDO_PIDS" ] || [ -n "$FOUND_HIM_PIDS" ]; then
    ./stop.sh
    sleep 2
fi
```

---

### 2. Watchdog Service (Option 1 - Full Implementation)

#### [watchdog.sh](../../watchdog.sh)
**Purpose:** Automated service health monitoring and recovery

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Watchdog Monitor Loop              │
│  (checks every 30s, configurable)           │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
               │
               ├─> Check MQTT Broker Reachable?
               │   └─> NO → Wait for recovery (up to 5 min)
               │
               ├─> Check waldo.py running?
               │   └─> NO → Record failure
               │
               ├─> Check found-him.py running?
               │   └─> NO → Record failure
               │
               └─> 3 consecutive failures?
                   └─> YES → Restart services
                       ├─> Stop all processes
                       ├─> Wait for broker if down
                       ├─> Start services
                       └─> Log restart event
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Health Monitoring:**
   - Broker connectivity checks (using `nc -zv`)
   - Process existence checks (using `pgrep`)
   - Configurable check interval (default: 30s)

2. **Restart Logic:**
   - Requires 3 consecutive failures before restart
   - Waits for broker recovery (up to 5 minutes)
   - Exponential backoff on connection attempts

3. **Restart Throttling:**
   - Maximum 3 restarts per 5-minute window
   - Prevents infinite restart loops
   - Logs all restart attempts to `logs/watchdog_restarts.log`

4. **State Management:**
   - PID file prevents multiple watchdog instances
   - Restart history tracking
   - Comprehensive logging to `logs/watchdog.log`

**Configuration Variables:**
```bash
WATCHDOG_CHECK_INTERVAL=30       # Health check frequency
WATCHDOG_MAX_RESTARTS=3          # Max restarts in window
WATCHDOG_RESTART_WINDOW=300      # 5 minute window
WATCHDOG_BROKER_TIMEOUT=5        # Broker connectivity timeout
```

#### macOS launchd Integration

**[com.synergy.watchdog.plist](../../com.synergy.watchdog.plist)**
- Automatic startup at login
- KeepAlive with network-aware restart
- Background process type
- Proper logging (stdout/stderr to separate files)
- 10-second throttle between restarts

**Installation Scripts:**
- [install-watchdog.sh](../../install-watchdog.sh) - Install as launchd service
- [uninstall-watchdog.sh](../../uninstall-watchdog.sh) - Remove launchd service

---

### 3. Unified Startup Command

#### [start-all.sh](../../start-all.sh)
**Purpose:** Single command for user's workflow

**User Requirements:**
1. Open terminal
2. Type ONE command
3. Leave terminal open and watch output
4. See desktop switches in real-time

**Implementation:**
```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# 1. Install watchdog (if needed)
# 2. Clean up orphaned processes
# 3. Start waldo.py in background
# 4. Start found-him.py in background
# 5. Show live desktop switches (foreground)

tail -F "$SYNERGY_LOG_PATH" | grep --line-buffered "switch from" | \
  sed -u -E 's/.*to "([^-]+).*/\1/' | while read desktop; do
    echo "$desktop"
done
```

**Output Format:**
```
✓ Services started (watchdog monitoring enabled)

dev
ey
studio
dev
```

Clean, simple output showing just base desktop names (everything before first `-`).

---

### 4. Configuration Management

#### Updated [.env](../../.env#L38-L49)
Added watchdog configuration section:

```bash
# === Watchdog Configuration (Optional) ===
WATCHDOG_CHECK_INTERVAL=30        # Health check interval (seconds)
WATCHDOG_MAX_RESTARTS=3           # Max restarts within window
WATCHDOG_RESTART_WINDOW=300       # Restart window (seconds)
WATCHDOG_BROKER_TIMEOUT=5         # Broker check timeout (seconds)
```

#### Created [.env.example](../../.env.example)
Template file with comprehensive comments for all configuration options.

---

### 5. Monitoring Tools

Created optional monitoring scripts:
- [monitor.sh](../../monitor.sh) - Watch Synergy log for switches
- [watch-desktops.sh](../../watch-desktops.sh) - Subscribe to MQTT and show messages

---

## Technical Patterns & Best Practices

### Shell Script Patterns

**1. Process Management:**
```bash
# Find processes by command pattern
PIDS=$(pgrep -f "pattern" || true)  # || true prevents error on no match

# Graceful shutdown with fallback
kill $PIDS 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 1
kill -9 $PIDS 2>/dev/null || true
```

**2. PID File Management:**
```bash
# Check for existing instance
if [ -f "$PID_FILE" ]; then
    OLD_PID=$(cat "$PID_FILE")
    if ps -p "$OLD_PID" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "Already running"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
echo $$ > "$PID_FILE"
```

**3. Network Connectivity Checks:**
```bash
# Test MQTT broker reachability
if nc -zv -w "$TIMEOUT" "$BROKER" "$PORT" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Broker is reachable
fi
```

**4. Exponential Backoff:**
```bash
reconnect_delay=1
max_delay=60
while ! connected; do
    sleep $reconnect_delay
    reconnect_delay=$((reconnect_delay * 2))
    if [ $reconnect_delay -gt $max_delay ]; then
        reconnect_delay=$max_delay
    fi
done
```

**5. Time-Based Throttling:**
```bash
# Track restarts within time window
window_start=$(($(date +%s) - RESTART_WINDOW))
count=$(awk -v start="$window_start" '$1 >= start { count++ } END { print count+0 }' history.log)
```

### Python Patterns

**1. MQTT Client Dependency Injection:**
- Abstract interfaces (`MQTTPublisherInterface`, `MQTTSubscriberInterface`)
- Factory pattern (`MQTTClientFactory`)
- Runtime client selection (Paho vs NanoMQ)

**2. Configuration Management:**
- Environment variable loading with `python-dotenv`
- CLI argument override capability
- Fallback to sensible defaults

### macOS Integration

**1. launchd Service Configuration:**
- `RunAtLoad: true` - Start at login
- `KeepAlive.NetworkState: true` - Wait for network
- `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit: false` - Only restart on crashes
- `ThrottleInterval: 10` - Prevent rapid restarts

**2. User-Level Services:**
```bash
LAUNCHD_DIR="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents"
launchctl load "$LAUNCHD_DIR/com.synergy.watchdog.plist"
launchctl list | grep synergy.watchdog  # Check status
```

## Recovery Scenarios Handled

The watchdog automatically handles:

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| MQTT Broker Crash | `nc -zv` check fails | Wait up to 5 min, then restart services |
| waldo.py Crash | `pgrep` finds no process | Record failure, restart after 3 checks |
| found-him.py Crash | `pgrep` finds no process | Record failure, restart after 3 checks |
| Network Interruption | Broker unreachable | Wait for network/broker recovery |
| Multiple Orphaned Processes | `start.sh` checks pgrep | Auto-cleanup via `stop.sh` |
| Restart Loop | Restart history tracking | Throttle at 3 restarts per 5 min |

---

## User Workflow (Final)

### Daily Use
```bash
# 1. Open terminal
# 2. Run one command:
./start-all.sh

# 3. Watch output:
# ✓ Services started (watchdog monitoring enabled)
#
# dev
# ey
# studio
# dev

# 4. Press Ctrl+C to stop watching (services keep running)
```

### Maintenance
```bash
# Stop everything
./stop.sh

# Check watchdog status
launchctl list | grep synergy.watchdog

# View logs
tail -f logs/watchdog.log

# Uninstall watchdog

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Watchdog Implementation
**Options Considered:**
1. Watchdog script with launchd (CHOSEN)
2. Enhanced retry logic only
3. systemd-style service management

**Rationale:**
- Balances simplicity with reliability
- Native macOS integration via launchd
- Automatic startup at login
- Minimal user intervention required

### Decision 2: Auto-Cleanup in start.sh
**Why:** Prevents orphaned process accumulation without requiring manual cleanup

**Implementation:** Check for existing processes before starting new ones

### Decision 3: Restart Throttling
**Why:** Prevents infinite restart loops during persistent failures

**Implementation:** Max 3 restarts per 5-minute window with time-based history tracking

### Decision 4: Broker Wait Logic
**Why:** Avoid premature restart attempts when broker is temporarily down

**Implementation:** Wait up to 5 minutes for broker recovery before giving up

### Decision 5: Unified start-all.sh Command
**Why:** User wanted single command for entire workflow

**Implementation:** Combined watchdog install + service start + live monitoring in one script

---

## Lessons Learned

### Investigation Process
1. **Validate assumptions early** - Initial hypothesis about macOS upgrade was wrong
2. **Check running processes** - `ps aux | grep` revealed the real issue immediately
3. **Review logs thoroughly** - Logs showed successful publishing, not service failure
4. **Test incrementally** - Validated each component (bindings, logs, connectivity) separately

### Design Insights
1. **Background services need cleanup** - Users may not remember to stop services before closing terminals
2. **Auto-recovery prevents support burden** - Watchdog eliminates manual intervention
3. **Output format matters** - User wanted simple output, not decorated/timestamped
4. **One command beats multiple steps** - UX improvement significantly reduces friction

### Technical Notes
1. **macOS launchd is robust** - KeepAlive with NetworkState handles most recovery scenarios
2. **Process patterns with pgrep** - More reliable than PID files for multi-instance scenarios
3. **Exponential backoff works** - Prevents overwhelming broker during recovery
4. **Time-based throttling required** - Prevents restart loops from persistent configuration errors

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Health check ping messages** - Detect stalled processes (not just missing ones)
2. **Metrics collection** - Track restart frequency, connection success rates
3. **Alerting integration** - Send notifications on excessive restarts
4. **Multi-broker failover** - Automatic failover to backup MQTT broker
5. **Web dashboard** - Real-time status view of all services
6. **Log rotation** - Automatic cleanup of old log files

### Why Not Implemented
- Out of scope for current user needs
- Would add complexity without immediate benefit
- Current solution handles all known failure scenarios

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern: Process Lifecycle Management
```bash
# start.sh - Check and cleanup before starting
pgrep -f "pattern" && ./stop.sh
# start services...

# stop.sh - Graceful with force fallback
kill $PID || true
sleep 1
kill -9 $PID || true
```

### Pattern: Watchdog Service
```bash
while true; do
    # Check health
    if ! healthy; then
        failures=$((failures + 1))
    else
        failures=0
    fi

    # Restart after threshold
    if [ $failures -ge $MAX_FAILURES ]; then
        restart_service
        failures=0
    fi

    sleep $CHECK_INTERVAL
done
```

### Pattern: launchd Service Template
```xml
<key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
<key>KeepAlive</key>
<dict>
    <key>SuccessfulExit</key><false/>
    <key>NetworkState</key><true/>
</dict>
```

### Pattern: Configuration Precedence
```python
# 1. CLI arguments (highest)
args = parser.parse_args()
# 2. Environment variables
Config.MQTT_BROKER = os.getenv('MQTT_BROKER', 'localhost')
# 3. Defaults (lowest)
```

## Session Metrics

- **Investigation Time:** ~30 minutes
- **Implementation Time:** ~90 minutes
- **Files Created:** 9
- **Files Modified:** 3
- **Lines of Code Added:** ~600
- **Tests Performed:** 6 major validation scenarios
- **Issues Resolved:** 1 (orphaned processes causing connection issues)
- **Features Delivered:** Automatic recovery watchdog service

---

## Conclusion

What appeared to be a macOS upgrade compatibility issue was actually a process management problem. The investigation led to implementing a comprehensive watchdog service that provides automatic recovery from all common failure scenarios, significantly improving system reliability.

The final solution gives the user a single-command workflow (`./start-all.sh`) that:
- Installs and configures automatic recovery
- Starts all services
- Provides live monitoring output
- Requires zero manual intervention for failures

The watchdog service will continue to benefit the user beyond this specific issue, providing automatic recovery from broker crashes, service crashes, and network interruptions.
