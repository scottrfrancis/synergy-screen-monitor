      Based on the git status output above, please analyze the changes and generate a commit message following the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

      The format should be:
      <type>[optional scope]: <description>

      [optional body]

      [optional footer(s)]

      Common types:
      - feat: A new feature
      - fix: A bug fix
      - docs: Documentation only changes
      - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
      - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
      - perf: A code change that improves performance
      - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
      - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
      - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
      - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
      - revert: Reverts a previous commit

      Please provide just the commit message, nothing else.
